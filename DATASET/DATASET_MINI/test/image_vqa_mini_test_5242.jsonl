The 25th Bombardment Group 417th Bombardment Squadron flew B-18 Bolo bombers from the airfield, known as Camaguey Air Base, from 13 April 1942 though August 1943. The squadron flew antisubmarine missions over the northern Caribbean. The base was also used for air-sea rescue missions by the 1st Rescue Squadron. From 1 January 1943, the USAAF set up postal operations for Camaguey using Army Post Office, Miami with the address: 2714 APO MIA. The United States Navy also set up to use a non-descript number for postal operations. They used the Fleet Post Office, Atlantic located in New York City with the address: 617 FPO NY. The airport also used to be a base for the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces with the 3685th Regiment and 2 General purpose transport squadron operating Mil Mi-17 helicopters based here.

The Rock of Cashel was the traditional seat of the kings of Munster as early as the 4th century and prior to the Norman invasion. In the 5th century, the Eóganachta clan built a fortress at Cashel retaining supremacy there for hundreds of years. In 977, Brian Boru was crowned there as king and made Cashel his capital.

The castle's construction began in 1352, in the reign of Bogusław V, whose reign began the alliance with the Hanseatic League. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the castle was used as a warehouse and a prison. In 1930, the castle was turned into a museum. The castle was enlarged and modernised in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, becoming a worthy royal residence. The greatest expansion of the castle was done under the reign of Eric of Pomerania, who rebuilt the castle to that of the design of his previous residence, Kronborg Castle. He also modernised the castle's defensive fortifications, and built a second defence line, in the form of dikes around the castle. The following expansion of the castle was done under the reign of Duke Bogusław X, when a new wing was built. The next changes were done by Duke Barnim XI. After a great fire, which devastated the castle in 1624, the last Duke of the House of Pomerania, Bogusław XIV, rebuilt the castle. However, he did not restore the castle to its original architectural style. The castle lost many of its defences, and a chapel was built inside the Duke Hall.

In November 2021, the government of Newfoundland and Labrador issued a request for proposals to design, build and finance a new prison to replace the aging HMP facility. The title of His Majesty's Prison (Grenada) is given to the Richmond Hill Prison in Saint George's, Grenada. The prison is run by the Ministry of National Security.
