The castle was enlarged and modernised in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, becoming a worthy royal residence. The greatest expansion of the castle was done under the reign of Eric of Pomerania, who rebuilt the castle to that of the design of his previous residence, Kronborg Castle. He also modernised the castle's defensive fortifications, and built a second defence line, in the form of dikes around the castle. The following expansion of the castle was done under the reign of Duke Bogusław X, when a new wing was built. The next changes were done by Duke Barnim XI. After a great fire, which devastated the castle in 1624, the last Duke of the House of Pomerania, Bogusław XIV, rebuilt the castle. However, he did not restore the castle to its original architectural style. The castle lost many of its defences, and a chapel was built inside the Duke Hall.
